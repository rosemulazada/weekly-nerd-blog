    "desc": "Rosa has done the same study as myself, Commnication and Multimedia Design, and is now taking a master's program on experiemental publishing. No wonder then that she would be so creatively inclined using electronics! Of course she has taken a different path from the rest of us, a very interesting one. I asked some friends who were able to attend about her and they shared with me that she worked a lot with UX React as a digital creative. It's interesting to see the different paths of CMD students. It really is such a broad study, you can branch into anything you want."
