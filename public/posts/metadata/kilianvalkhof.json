Today, he wanted to talk to us about the rule of least power. I have to say that this was the talk that really made me realise that I needed to choose my programming language of choice wisely, and to be wary not to fall behind on new advancements in these languages (especially JavaScript, but now more than ever also CSS) just because I've done something similar and 'that works, so I'll just re-use it.'"
