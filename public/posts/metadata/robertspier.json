    "desc": "Robert is a former CMD lecturer who taught tech related subjects such as Information Design-Tech. He now works as a Creative Technologist at Deloitte. He was once a CMD student just like us. He studied media design at ROC Flevoland, followed by CMD and Information Science at the University of Amsterdam. He worked at Clarify (formerly Booreiland) and also served as a creative producer in Amsterdam nightlife. Describing himself as a digital superhero, he engages in front-end development, research in emerging technologies, qualitative user research, stakeholder management, creative problem-solving, and automation. His expertise includes HTML, CSS (Sass), JavaScript (TypeScript), heavily leveraging Vite and Svelte(Kit). While Angular, .NET, NodeJS, and Azure are in his toolkit, he prefers GitHub Desktop over terminal commands. <em>He'll be discussing people like us: those who build using tech.</em>"
