## Accessibility

Q42 is always striving to truly understand the perspective of disabled individuals to develop as selflessly as possible. The WCAG rarely encompasses enough standards to ensure that a website is safe and usable for disabled people. This is so situational that you cannot just make a checklist to cross off all the points needed for accessibility. Thankfully, the WCAG is constantly growing and becoming more specific, as well as being used more often.

Q42 wanted to show us three cases where they did exclusive design: designing and developing for a very specific target audience.

## SenseMath

They worked with Visio (an expert center for visual disabilities in the Netherlands) to create an app for blind individuals to navigate mathematical equations and illustrations. Math is typically visual, with equations and graphs on paper, but what if you’re blind? They collaborated with two blind individuals who pushed themselves to the limit to create the best app possible. Previously, blind people had to use swell paper, where the graph would be raised above the paper, requiring them to feel out the graph with their fingers. This process would take several minutes, while sighted people could understand the graph in seconds by looking.

They demonstrated several graphs represented in sound, which was fascinating. The sounds they created made sense according to the graphs they were meant to represent, meaning the sounds matched the visual representation of the graphs. Every subtle change had to be audible. They worked with an incredible sound designer who helped them test and develop the right sounds to represent lines in a graph!
