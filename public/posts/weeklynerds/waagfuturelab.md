## Waag's Approach to Mobile Phone Ecosystems

Waag works with the mobile phone, a stacked ecosystem consisting of:

- Content
- Services
- Apps
- Software libraries
- Firmware
- OS
- Hardware
- And much more

They focus on what is valuable to the user. For instance, on the Booking.com website, aspects such as budget, discounts, the look-and-feel of the hotel (images), and location are crucial. This approach helps them assess the worth of an app based on public values.

### Layers of Waag's Approach

**Fundament**
This layer comprises the context in which something exists or develops.

**Design Process**
Every context and experience being digitized has a deciding influence on how the digitalization will take shape. A good design process is dependent on the project, the values, and the device.

**Burger Central**
The user is viewed as a citizen in a democratic society, not just a consumer in a business model or at the bottom of a state. The user stands at the top of the stack. This concept focuses on how we handle interaction with technology: how we use it and how it uses us.
