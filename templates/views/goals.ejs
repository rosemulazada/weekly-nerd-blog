                During this minor, we're lucky to receive (usually) weekly
                lectures - also called the Weekly Nerd - from various figures in
                the industry. A range of different people, with different
                backgrounds, different passions and jobs that have one thing in
                common; their passion for the web and creating for the web.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's a lot to take away from the Weekly Nerds, and even more
                to take with us as we approach the Meesterproef. Here's what I
                wanna focus on when that time comes.
